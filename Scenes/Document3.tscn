Hiya,

Sorry for not replying, I've been feeling kinda under the weather. Picked up some weird pendant thing and feeling real itchy now. Threw it out the airlock which probably wasn't the best idea but I doubt anyone will miss that thing anyway, looked as if it had been thrown out.

I'll be back in action when I'm feeling better but till then keep at it."

Hello, 

Thanks again for the gift, super easy to cut into and it looks even better on the inside. Felt really itchy but I polished it up and turned it into a pendant. I might give it to Sarah since I still owe her one.
